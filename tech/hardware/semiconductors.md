# Semiconductors

* Electrical conductivity b/w conductors and insulators
* Resistivity falls as temperature rises (opposite to metals)
* Poor conductors in natural state
* Conducting properties can be altered by doping (adding impurities to the crystal structure)
* Semiconductor Junction = 2 differently doped regions in the same crystal
    * Behaviour of charge carriers (electrons, ions, electron holes) at the junction = basis of modern electronics
* Eg: silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide
* GaAs - used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave frequency ICs
* Semiconductor Devices
    * Pass current in one direction more easily than the other
    * Variable resistance
    * Sensitive to heat and light
    * Properties can be modified by doping, application of electrical fields or light
        Used for amplification, switching and energy conversion
* Doping
    * Conductivity increased by adding small amount of pentavalent (Sb, P, As) or trivalent (B, Ga, In) atoms
    * p-type: mostly free holes (shortage of electrons): doped with acceptor impurities
    * n-type: mostly free electrons (excess of electrons): doped with donor impurities
    * Creates the p-n junction
    * Wafer put in a 1100 degree C chamber, then atoms injected
    * Can improve the conductivity by factor of thousands or millions



* 1904: First practical application: cat's-whisker detector (used in early radio receivers)
* Developments in quantum physics led to development of transistors, ICs, MOSFETs
* Carrier generation and recombination: Processes by which charge carriers (electrons and holes) are created and eliminated
* LED: excited electrons relax by emitting light
* High thermal conductivity can be used for heat dissipation
* Large thermo-electric power factor: useful for thermal generators, thermoelectric coolers
* Preparation of Semiconducting Material for ICs
    * Need high degree of crystalline perfection
        Larger the crystal, more challenging to achieve
    * Thermal Oxidation
        Silicon dioxide on the surface used as gate insulator and field oxide
    * Photomasks
    * Photolithography
        Creates pattern on the circuitry
        UV light used with photoresist layer
    * Etching, usually Plasma Etching
    * Diffusion/Doping

* History
    * 1821: Thomas Johann Seebeck observed the thermoelectric effect
    * 1833: Michael Faraday reported Silver Sulphide resistance decreases with increase in temperature
    * 1839: Alexandre Edmond Becqerel observed photovoltaic effect
    * 1873: Willoughby Smith discovered selenium resistors show decrease in resistance when light falls on them
    * 1874: Karl Ferdinand Braun developed the crystal detector (first semiconductor device)
    * Arthur Schuster found that copper oxide layer on wires has rectification properties that cease when wires are cleaned
    * 1876: William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day observed photovoltaic effect in selenium

* 7 nm, 5 nm: 
    * There's nothing 7 nm long on a 7 nm chip. Then what does it mean???
        * Till 28 nm, it was the length of the transistor
        * After that, we switched to FINFET (like a shark's fin, with gate wrapped around it)
            Gate length is not directly measurable
            Now the length is what it would have been if we shrunk the transistor
        * Future: "Gate all around"
            Silicon nano wires, through the middle of the gates
                Can control the current more effectively
        * After that: no one knows

* Fabs:
    * Modern fab cost ~ $10B
    * Capacity > 50,000 300 mm wafer-starts per month
    * Depreciation = ~$100 per second
        Needs business of $500 per second to justify
    * Samsung, Intel, TSMC
    * Samsung and Intel are also IDM (make their own chips) - integrated device manufacturers
