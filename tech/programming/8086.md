# 8086/88
* The chip had physical storage for registers, named AX, BX, and so on.
* Each register could hold 16 bits
* Data moved between memory and registers over a bus

## Instruction decode
Actual electrical process that takes an instruction stream and turns it into an actual electrical action on registers and memory.

Typical format:
```
      BYTE 1              BYTE 2       
| | | | | | | | |   | | | | | | | | |  ...
|   OPCODE  |D|W|   |MOD| REG | R/M |
```

## MOV
MOV: copy data from one location to another (not a literal move)

### Register-register mov
MOV AX,BX 
    MOV : the mnemonic
    AX : destination register
    BX: source register

The assembler *encodes* the assembly language instruction written by a human into binary format that the instruction decoder used to *decode* and execute the instruction

Register-register move is a 2 byte encoded instruction
Most significant 6 bits: opcode
bits 7,8: D and W flags
2nd byte: MOD (2 bits), REG (3 bits), R/M (3 bits)

D: 0 = register field is not the destination, 1 = register is the destination (R/M is the other field)
W: 1 = wide register (16 bits), 0 = 8 bits 
MOD: memory or register operation
REG: encodes a register
R/M: encodes a register or memory

MOV AX,BX -> copy full BX into AX
MOV AL,BL -> copy lower 8 bits from BX to lower bits of AX
MOV AH,BH -> copy higher 8 bits from BX to higher bits of AX

### Register-memory mov
`MOV BX, [<memory_address>]` // Load data from the given memory address to BX. Address is in square brackets.
`eg: MOV BX, [75]` // Load data from the 76th (0-indexed) memory location
                 // This will load byte 76 and 77 since we need 2 bytes        

* So the memory location is just an index into the array that is memory. Pointers are also exactly this.

`MOV [75], BX` // Write data from BX into slot 76 and 77 in the memory

Effective Address calculation:
`MOV BX [BP + 75]`
    Get whetever is in the BP register, add 75 and then look in that memory index

`MOV BX, [2.AX + BX + 7]` // this is not legal
* R/M field encodes the type of address 
* MOD field: whether if has a displacement (+75 kind of thing)
    00: doesn't generally have a displacement `[...]`
        exception:  if R/M is 110, there is a 16bit displacement, so there are 2 extra bytes
    01: 8 bit displacement `[... + 8_bit_value]`. Has one extra byte in the instruction. 
    10: 16 bit displacement `[... + 16_bit_value]`. Has two extra bytes in the instruction. 

* R/M Field: which equation out of a set of 8 equation we need, eg. BX + SI, BX + PI, etc.


### Immediate to register mov
* A value encoded into the instruction stream (not in a separate memory location)
* e.g.: mov AX, 12
```
      BYTE 1              BYTE 2            BYTE 3     
| | | | | | | | |   | | | | | | | | |   | | | | | | | | |
|1 0 1 1|W| REG |   |   Lower byte  |   |  Higher byte  |
```

### Immediate to memory mov
mov [BP+75], byte 12 // put the number 12 in byte form (8 bits)
mov [BP+75], word 12 // put the number 12 in word form (16 bits)

## ADD
`ADD AX, BX`: AX = AX + BX

Encoding is similar to MOV.

```asm

MOV AX, [BP]
MOV BX, [BP + 2]
ADD AX, BX

; the above can be optimised to:
MOV AX, [BP]
ADD AX, [BP + 2] ; no need for BX
```


SUB and CMP also follow similar patterns to ADD and MOV
