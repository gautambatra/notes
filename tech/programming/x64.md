# x64 Assembly
* Registers are capable of storing 64 bits of data
* `EAX`, `EBX`, `EBP`, etc: 32 bit registers
* `RAX`, `RBX`, `RBP`, etc: 64 bit registers
* IP and FLAGS registers have similar prefixes: `RIP`, `EIP`, `EFLAGS`, `RFLAGS`
* `AL`, `AH`, `AX`, etc are still accessible for backwards compatibility
* 8 new registers: `R8`, `R9`, `R10`, `R11`, `R12`, `R13`, `R14`, `R15` 
    * Start at 8 as we are counting the original 8 registers as 0 through 7
    * 64 bits wide
    * Can access 8, 16, 32 bits using suffixes B (byte), W (word), D (double word) respectively. 
    * Eg: `R10D`, `R10B`, etc.
* For operations that don't involve registers, we can specify the width of the operands using the keywords `BYTE` (8 bits), `WORD` (16 bits), `DWORD` (32 bits), `QWORD` (64 bits)
* Memory expressions can contain any 2 registers plus a displacement, unlike 8086 which had fixed combinations. The second term can have a scalar 1, 2, 4, or 8. Eg., `[EAX + 8*ESI]`, `[RSI + 4*RDI + 4]`
